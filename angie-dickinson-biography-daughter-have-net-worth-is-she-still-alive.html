It was then that she changed her surname from Brown to Dickinson.&nbsp;However, they separated in 1960 without any children in the marriage.</span></p><p><span>The actress then met Burt Bacharach with whom she tied the knot in 1965. She, however, retains the surname “Dickinson” from her previous marriage due to her popularity with that name.&nbsp;The following year, their only daughter together, Lea Nikki Bacharach was born.&nbsp;Unfortunately, it was a three month premature birth.&nbsp;Nikki had a few unfortunate complications including: visual impairment and Asperger’s Syndrome.</span></p><p><strong><span>See also: What was Ann Margret’s affair with Elvis Presley, who is the husband?</span></strong></p><p><span>Due to this condition, Angie Dickinson has turned down a lot of big roles just to cure her daughter in the best possible way.&nbsp;However, Nikki was then placed in a psychiatric treatment center for adolescents for a period of nine years.&nbsp;Nikki managed to get into California Lutheran University, but after graduating, she could no longer pursue a career there because of the visual impairment she suffered from.&nbsp;Unfortunately, Nikki Bacharach committed suicide by suffocation in her apartment in the Thousand Oaks neighborhood of Ventura County to escape her situation.&nbsp;This happened on January 4, 2007, at the age of 40.</span></p><p><span>Interestingly, when she was a little girl, her father Burt wrote a song called Nikki for his fragile daughter.</span></p><h2><strong><span>Is she still alive?</span></strong></h2><p><span>The Hollywood veteran is alive and well, over 86, she is still healthy and going strong.&nbsp;More recently, Angie Dickinson was spotted outside her home in Los Angeles when she went out to dump trash wearing a hat, a large white sweater, black pants and flip flops.</span></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r63Io5innaeoe6S7zGiZrrKqZL2mu8%2BlnGiZnpy2pnnDopqkoZ6ovK95waKmoKqRpbW6ecOarKCgpJq%2FbrTAr5xmppWperi70a2fZqGjYsCpsYysq6KknGKurbXVnmY%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fangie-dickinson-biography-daughter-have-net-worth-is-she-still-alive.html&text=Angie%20Dickinson%20Biography%2c%20Daughter%2c%20Have%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Is%20She%20Still%20Alive%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fangie-dickinson-biography-daughter-have-net-worth-is-she-still-alive.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fangie-dickinson-biography-daughter-have-net-worth-is-she-still-alive.html&title=Angie%20Dickinson%20Biography%2c%20Daughter%2c%20Have%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Is%20She%20Still%20Alive%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fangie-dickinson-biography-daughter-have-net-worth-is-she-still-alive.html&title=Angie%20Dickinson%20Biography%2c%20Daughter%2c%20Have%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Is%20She%20Still%20Alive%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fangie-dickinson-biography-daughter-have-net-worth-is-she-still-alive.html&title=Angie%20Dickinson%20Biography%2c%20Daughter%2c%20Have%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Is%20She%20Still%20Alive%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fangie-dickinson-biography-daughter-have-net-worth-is-she-still-alive.html&description=Angie%20Dickinson%20Biography%2c%20Daughter%2c%20Have%20Net%20Worth%2c%20Is%20She%20Still%20Alive%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./lyrics-brent-faiyaz-with-personification.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Brent faiyaz with personification lyrics">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./anant-ambani-net-worth-2024.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Anant Ambani Net Worth 2024">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
