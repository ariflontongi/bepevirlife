Mukbang is a career that involves consuming anything delicious!</p><p>On her YouTube channel “Hungry Fatchick,” which she started over ten years ago, Godiva indulges in posting videos of herself gorging on fast food and takeaway.</p><p>Since then, her YouTube channel has grown in popularity, with over 240,000 followers and more than 50 million views as of right now.</p><p>Her YouTube career has now become quite successful and promising.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Early_Life_of_Candy_Godiva></span><strong>Early Life of </strong><strong>Candy Godiva</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>In Oak Ridge, Tennessee, she was born on September 18, 1972. She frequently moved as a small kid, going from Tennessee to Maryland to Louisiana before settling down in South Louisiana to be raised by her grandmother and grandfather.</p><p>She has described having a half-sister, albeit she never had the chance to get to know her properly. She moved to Las Vegas, Nevada, as soon as she became of legal age.</p><p>She met her ex-husband, who had recently been released from prison, soon after moving, and they were married two weeks later despite their short-lived love.</p><p>They have a boy and a girl who is raised by their paternal grandma.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Candy_Godiva_Age></span>Candy Godiva Age<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Candy Godiva is currently <strong>51 years old </strong>as of 2023 because she was born on 18 September 1972.</p><p>At such a young age, she has managed to gain a substantial following on her YouTube channel.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Candy_Godiva_Career></span><strong>Candy Godiva Career</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/i0.wp.com/www.nextbiography.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Candy-godiva.jpg><p>On December 6, 2010, Candy formally started her YouTube channel. Her first on-camera eating video went live as soon as she started the channel with the name “Hungry Fatchick.”</p><p>Her debut video, “Hungry Fatchick Visits a Sonic Drive-In,” has amassed over 240,000 views to far. Despite her immediate success, she didn’t start routinely uploading videos until 2017.</p><p>It’s reasonable to think that such movies would draw a lot of negative attention, but fortunately, it was just moderate. In fact, she attracted a sizable following that is still expanding.</p><p>Candy started sharing her incredibly well-liked mukbang films as a side gig to her already prosperous adult web modeling profession.</p><p>Soon after discovering how common mukbang videos were in South Korea, she made the decision to begin uploading them. English translation of the South Korean word “mukbang,” which means “eat,” is “eat”.</p><p>The trend was launched in 2011 by South Korean Youtubers who uploaded films showing themselves eating a lot of food without speaking at all. It is intended to amuse viewers who have a fascination with this kind of unusual content.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Great_Successes></span>Great Successes<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Since then, it has gained popularity all around the world, and Americans like Candy jumped on board this rich train as soon as possible.</p><p>Candy’s popularity grew rapidly as a result of her willingness to explore a range of different meals and her capacity to overindulge in calories at every meal.</p><p>Her desire to pursue a career in mukbang videos is ironic given that she has battled depression, body image issues, and binge eating her entire life.</p><h3 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=More_Things_of_Her_Life></span>More Things of Her Life<span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h3><p>Her first memories of the trigger leading to the development of her unhealthy relationship with food date back to her early years, when her parents would give her sweets and copious amounts of food as rewards for good behavior.</p><p>“I believe that was the beginning of my weight gain, the first stage of my starving, and the loss of my good metabolism going from being famished to essentially being force-fed.</p><p>“Here, have a cookie, eat some pie, and have a slice of cake,” it was like. That will cheer you up right here. I was a balloon by the time I was in first and second grade.</p><p>Additionally, she frequently includes sporadic emotional asides in her videos, indicating that she still struggles with many of the mental health problems that date back to her early years.</p><p>“I carry a lot of misery, so when I say I’m glad, I really can be joyful. Unbelievably sad, that’s what I mean. Despite all of her obstacles, she never lost sight of her goal of becoming someone.</p><p>She focused on building a strong YouTube channel and eventually rose to prominence as an American mukbanger.</p><p>The video she released on October 16, 2017, titled “Jollibee Mukbang Eating Show,” has received over 2.5 million views as of this writing.</p><p>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=#>Colby Brock YouTuber Biography</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Candy_Godiva_Personal_Life></span><strong>Candy Godiva Personal Life</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Early in 2020, Candy Godiva was still single.

The couple insisted that they were only good friends once it proved that the rumor was false.</p><p>In addition, Candy is rumor-free and has avoided any controversy involving her personal or professional life.</p><p>It appears that the “Mukbang” star is currently more focused on her career, her YouTube channel, and other things.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Candy_Godiva_Net_Worth></span><strong>Candy Godiva Net Worth</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Candy Godiva, a YouTuber, is thought to be worth $100,000. Before taxes, she received about $100k from her 46 million views.</p><p>The majority of Godiva’s wealth comes from sponsorships and YouTube channel adverts. Numerous variables, such as video length, viewer country, audience retention, or month of the year, have an impact on YouTube revenues.</p><p>Also Read:&nbsp;<a href=#>Who is YouTuber JiDion?</a></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Physical_Appearance></span><strong>Physical Appearance</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>Candy Godiva is a Mukbang YouTuber who stands at 5 feet, 1 inch (155 cm), which is not particularly tall.

Candy’s body also has measurements of 54-61-49 inches for her hips, waist, and breast.</p><p>Fortunately, Candy is a healthy person.
