Its people, colors, gastronomy and culture are a delight to experience.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The biodiverse North American paradise, though, is far more than a burgeoning celebrity hotspot. “Costa Rica, home to over 500,000 species of wildlife, emphasizes the dominance of nature,” says Harry Shum Jr., who was born there. “The country’s motto, ‘Pura Vida,’ reflects a commitment to a pure and fulfilling life, as evidenced by its high life expectancy.” About a quarter of the country’s land mass is protected. “Costa Rica is the promised land without artificial ingredients,” adds Costa Rican film director Laura Astorga, describing the country as a place where “we can swim in always warm waves, where we can be very long-lived, where it is possible to see any wild animal up close because they are not afraid of us — we have never been their predators.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">Some 2.5 million tourists visit annually for lush rainforest adventures, volcanic hot springs, magnificent beaches, surfing, yoga and incredible wildlife (such as humpback whales, sloths, jaguars, scarlet macaws and superpods of spinner dolphins). Costa Rica contains nearly 6 percent of the world’s biodiversity, yet it’s a bit smaller than West Virginia. Its Nicoya Peninsula is also one of the globes’s five Blue Zones, where people historically live long, healthy lives (residents live to an average age of 85). AOL co-founder Steve Case likens Costa Rica to “Hawaii 50 years ago.”</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.hollywoodreporter.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Palmares-Outpost-Waterbike.jpg><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">According to Jason Moloney, artistic director and co-owner of prototyping and design company JxJ, “There’s a sense of adventure in the untouched wilderness that is impossible to fabricate.”</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">It doesn’t hurt that there is an ever-increasing number of glamorous, exclusive and ultra-luxurious places to call home base — from sprawling resorts to private villas and residences — many of which have bowed in the northwest part of the country on two peninsulas.</p><h2 class="heading larva // lrv-a-font-accent-l">Peninsula Papagayo</h2><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">From an Oscar-winning leading lady to an actress and her rocker beau, many Hollywood types have been guests — and are owners — at <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener nofollow">Peninsula Papagayo</a>.</p><p class="paragraph larva // a-font-body-m">The 1,400-acre low-density, high-security sanctuary comprises multiple resorts and real estate developments, plus a private club, art program, marina for yachts up to 200 feet, and naturalist-guided activity outfitter (think mangrove water biking, outrigger canoeing and surfing Witch’s Rock).
