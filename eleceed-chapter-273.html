The man reveals his name as Remy, and he claims to be a member of the Order of the Black Sun, a secret organization that seeks to destroy all Awakened beings. Remy also reveals that he has a personal grudge against Kayden because Kayden killed his brother, who was also a member of the Order.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.newsunzip.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/11/Eleceed-Chapter-273-release-date.jpg><p>Remy unleashes his full power, which is the ability to manipulate gravity. He uses his power to crush Kayden with immense force, and also to create black holes that suck in everything around them. Kayden tries to fight back, but he is overwhelmed by Remy’s power and speed. Remy mocks Kayden for being weak and arrogant, and he says that he will kill him and take his power.</p><p>Meanwhile, Jiwoo and the others are still trapped in the underground facility, where they are surrounded by hostile Awakened animals. Jiwoo tries to calm down the animals and communicate with them, but he finds out that they are being controlled by someone else. He realizes that someone is using a device that emits a signal that affects the animals’ minds and makes them aggressive. He decides to find the source of the signal and destroy it, hoping that it will free the animals from the control.</p><p>Jiwoo and the others split up and search for the device, while fighting off the animals along the way. Jiwoo encounters a giant snake that tries to swallow him, but he manages to escape and find the device. He sees that it is a small box with a red button and a timer. He presses the button, hoping that it will turn off the device, but instead, it activates a self-destruct mechanism. The timer shows that the device will explode in 10 seconds, and Jiwoo realizes that he has been tricked.</p><p>Jiwoo tries to run away from the device, but he is too late. The device explodes, creating a huge blast that shakes the entire facility. The explosion also reaches the surface, where Kayden and Remy are fighting. The blast interrupts their fight and catches them off guard. Kayden sees the explosion and recognizes it as the same one that happened when he first met Jiwoo. He realizes that Jiwoo is in danger, and he decides to abandon the fight and go to save him. Remy tries to stop him, but Kayden ignores him and runs towards the explosion site.</p><p>The chapter ends with a cliffhanger, as Kayden reaches the explosion site and sees a huge crater. He calls out for Jiwoo, but there is no answer. He wonders if Jiwoo is still alive, and he hopes that he is not too late.</p><p><strong>Read Also:- <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Eleceed Chapter 272 Release Date</a></strong></p><h2 class=wp-block-heading><span class=ez-toc-section id=Where_To_Read></span><strong>Where To Read</strong><span class=ez-toc-section-end></span></h2><p>If you want to read Eleceed Chapter 273, you have two options.

The man said that he had been waiting for Kayden for a long time and that he had a score to settle with him. He also said that he knew Kayden’s true identity and power and that he wanted to take it from him. He then attacked Kayden with a powerful punch, but Kayden blocked it with his arm.</p><p>Kayden asked the man who he was and what he wanted, but the man did not answer. He said that he would make Kayden remember him and that he would make him pay for what he had done. He then revealed that he was also an Awakened being and that he had a power that was similar to Kayden’s. He said that he could manipulate energy and that he could use it to create anything he wanted. He then created a sword out of energy and slashed at Kayden, but Kayden dodged it.</p><p>Kayden realized that the man was not an ordinary Awakened being and that he was very dangerous. He decided to fight back, and he also created a sword out of energy. He clashed with the man, and they exchanged blows. The man said that he was impressed by Kayden’s power, but that he was still no match for him. He said that he had trained for years to surpass Kayden and that he had learned many secrets about him. He said that he knew Kayden’s weakness and that he would exploit it.</p><p>Meanwhile, Jiwoo and the others were still trapped in the underground facility, where they had encountered a group of Awakened animals. The animals were hostile and aggressive, and they attacked Jiwoo and the others. Jiwoo tried to use his power to communicate with the animals, but he found out that they were not acting normally. He sensed that they were being influenced by something and that they were not in control of themselves. He wondered what was causing them to act this way, and who was behind it. The chapter ended with a cliffhanger, as Kayden and the man continued their fight, and Jiwoo and the others continued their escape.</p><p>The man said that he had a surprise for Kayden and that he would show him something that he had never seen before. He then activated his power and created a huge sphere of energy around them. He said that the sphere was a gravity field and that he could control the gravity inside it. He said that he could increase or decrease the gravity as he wished and that he could use it to crush Kayden or throw him around. He said that he had mastered this power and that he was the only one who could use it. He said that he was the ultimate gravity user and that he would prove it by killing Kayden.</p><p><strong>Also See:- <a href=# rel="noreferrer noopener">Eleceed Chapter 271 Release Date</a></strong></p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7r7HWrKynspmle6S7zGikmqaYrK5wscuemp6dlGKwqa3PrZyrZWJsgHA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2feleceed-chapter-273.html&text=Eleceed%20Chapter%20273%20Spoiler%2c%20Release%20Date%2c%20Recap%2c%20Raw%20Scan%2c%20Where%20to%20Read%20%26amp%3b%20What%20to%20Expect&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2feleceed-chapter-273.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2feleceed-chapter-273.html&title=Eleceed%20Chapter%20273%20Spoiler%2c%20Release%20Date%2c%20Recap%2c%20Raw%20Scan%2c%20Where%20to%20Read%20%26amp%3b%20What%20to%20Expect" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2feleceed-chapter-273.html&title=Eleceed%20Chapter%20273%20Spoiler%2c%20Release%20Date%2c%20Recap%2c%20Raw%20Scan%2c%20Where%20to%20Read%20%26amp%3b%20What%20to%20Expect" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2feleceed-chapter-273.html&title=Eleceed%20Chapter%20273%20Spoiler%2c%20Release%20Date%2c%20Recap%2c%20Raw%20Scan%2c%20Where%20to%20Read%20%26amp%3b%20What%20to%20Expect" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2feleceed-chapter-273.html&description=Eleceed%20Chapter%20273%20Spoiler%2c%20Release%20Date%2c%20Recap%2c%20Raw%20Scan%2c%20Where%20to%20Read%20%26amp%3b%20What%20to%20Expect" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./elena-kampouris-height-age-boyfriend-biography-wiki-net-worth-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Elena Kampouris Height, Age, Boyfriend, Biography, Wiki, Net Worth">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./edge-trolls-finn-balor-austin-theorys-thirst-trap-photo.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Edge Trolls Finn Balor &amp;amp; Austin Theorys Thirst Trap Photo">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
