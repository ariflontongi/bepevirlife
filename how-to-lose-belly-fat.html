It's natural: There have been so many changes we've all been through in the past less than two years, and with constant change, bodies change too. Plus, the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>American Institute of Stress</a> confirms that there's a correlation between spikes in the stress hormone cortisol (which have been plentiful for a lot of people lately) and weight gain, specifically increases in belly fat.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_3-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">From a health standpoint, belly fat is a common concern. "Regardless of your weight, we know that belly fat increases your risk of insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes, cardiovascular disease, stroke, and even colorectal cancer," explains <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>Yasmin Akhunji, MD</a>, an internist and thyroid specialist at telehealth practice <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=2 rel=nofollow>Paloma Health</a>. Belly fat is also a risk factor for "metabolic syndrome," which includes conditions like high blood pressure, blood sugar, and cholesterol, even if you're a young person, she adds (and if you're noticing difficulty in managing weight or metabolism, it's worth having your doctor check your thyroid hormones to make sure the levels are healthy).</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_5-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Trimming belly fat may be even more difficult for women in some cases. First of all, women typically have a higher percentage of body fat than men to begin with, according to the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Cleveland Clinic</a>. And on top of that, it's easy to gain belly fat especially during menopause, when hormone levels drop off and contribute to a slower metabolism. Sometimes losing belly fat could be as small changes as incorporating more whole foods into each meal, or planning your meals ahead of time using a meal prep tool. Then, of course, there are the bigger picture habits, like how much alcohol you drink and how well you're able to handle stress that might factor into your eating.</p><figure id=mntl-sc-block_7-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-image mntl-sc-block-universal-image mntl-sc-block-image--no-theme no-theme mntl-sc-block-image figure-landscape figure-high-res"><span class=figure-article-caption-owner>Marko Geber/Getty Images</span></figure><p id=mntl-sc-block_8-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Read on for more tips on how to lose belly fat, while keeping a healthy mindset.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_10-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>1. Make sure you're loading up on protein, fiber, and healthy fats.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_11-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Probably the top way to lose belly fat is to minimize processed foods, especially refined carbohydrates and sugars where possible. To be clear, that doesn't mean you should never eat those things that you enjoy (cough, pizza), but research published in the <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Journal of Nutrition </a>found that cutting back on carbs even more so than fat leads to fat loss. With fewer carbs, you'll want to add more protein, whole grains, and healthy fats to your diet.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_13-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">You'll also want to bulk up on fiber. "It's especially important for weight management, chronic disease risk, and GI regularity," says Jaclyn London, MS, RD, CDN, Head of Nutrition & Wellness at <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>WW</a>. "Fiber, especially prebiotic fiber, can help optimize the biological environment in your GI tract over time by providing fuel for your body's own probiotics to survive and thrive," she adds. Lead with a plant-based diet, including plenty of whole grains (which a newly published study associates with less of an increase in waist circumference compared to eating a diet filled with refined grains like white bread and pasta). For those probiotics, London recommends incorporating lots of fermented foods, like miso, tempeh, kimchi, and artichokes, asparagus, and bananas for prebiotic fiber. You'll be able to stay full with protein-packed healthy fats, including seafood, nuts and seeds, beans, lentils, chickpeas, and peas.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_17-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>2. Cut back on alcohol.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_18-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">If a number of drinks are in your regular rotation at or after mealtime each day, it might be worth revisiting that. Too much alcohol is associated with belly fat, according to Dr. Akhunji. "This was seen in just adding <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1 rel=nofollow>one additional alcoholic beverage daily</a>," she says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_20-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">This isn't to say that you shouldn't have a drink to celebrate an occasion or to never have a glass of wine with dinner. <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>Studies</a> have shown that it's all about quantity when it comes to reducing belly fat, and it's healthiest to keep drinking to a 2-drink maximum whenever you're sipping on wine, cocktails, or any other alcoholic beverage of choice.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_22-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>3. Eat more frequently.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_23-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">To keep your metabolism going, London suggests eating consistently, every three to four hours or so (that means no skipping meals, especially breakfast!). Make sure your meals and snacks are regular, she says. And the snacks especially should be high in protein and fiber — time to bust out those nuts and seed — so that you're actually satisfied in between meals.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_25-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There's some conflicting research about whether eating smaller, more frequent meals actually contributes to weight loss or not, but London maintains that consistency is key. It'll keep you in a healthy routine and won't encourage you to overeat in the evening if you've skipped lunch, for example.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_27-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>4. Drink tons of water.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_28-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Hydrating yourself adequately is always going to be important for your health. "While there's no direct link between water and weight loss, staying properly hydrated helps you stay alert, energized, and helps everything run smoothly in your body — from temperature to digestion and more," London says.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_30-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">There's not one general "hydration goal" for everyone, because each person's body and weight is different. For most people, London suggests drinking between nine and twelve eight-ounce cups of mostly water (but coffee and tea are included in that) per day. If you're working out, add two to three cups of water. Eating more water-filled fruits and veggies will also help you stay more hydrated, too.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_32-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>5. Plan your meals.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_33-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Meal prep is for more than just keeping you organized. It keeps you on task with eating meals that will nourish you and provide you with the macronutrients you need. If you're not someone who wants to eat the same thing every day or forgo spontaneity with eating, that's fine. "Identify a few meals that you know you can cook even when you're tired, stressed, or totally over it," London says. And stock your pantry and fridge with the ingredients for those dishes to give you a plan to stick to.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_35-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Don't feel the need to be so regimented with your meals and snacks, even if you're looking to lose weight. Translation: You really don't have to skip dessert! Try to sidestep hidden sources of sugar, like in pre-made smoothies or other sugary beverages, and even some pasta sauces and dressings. That leaves more room to enjoy a true dessert, London says.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_37-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>6. Practice mindful eating.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_38-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">While you're in the meal prepping mindset, take that same thoughtful approach when you're actually eating. It can reduce stress and stress-eating, says Dr. Akhunji. Though the goal of mindful eating is not weight loss or trimming fat, a <a href=# data-component=link data-source=inlineLink data-type=externalLink data-ordinal=1>2017 study</a> found that it is a healthier way of enjoying your meals, and may possibly be tied to maintenance of a healthy weight. That's mostly because you're slowing down, listening to your hunger cues, and making eating choices more deliberately when you're practicing mindful eating.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_40-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">"Take a few deep breaths before your first bite of every snack or meal, eating slowly and without distraction, and tune into how your body feels when you eat," Dr. Akhunji says. Making a habit out of this practice may not have proven belly fat loss benefits, but it's definitely a positive for your digestion and mental state.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_42-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>7. Work on a regular exercise and sleep routine.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_43-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's not all about dietary choices. As expected, working out is a major factor in losing belly fat. But just doing ab exercises is not the only way to target belly fat. Like eating, keeping exercise consistent is best, so find your niche in the fitness world, even if you're not doing the exact same routine every time — but do it every day. "A mix of cardiovascular and strength training is critical to include as part of your repertoire — both for the benefits of physical activity, but also to help regulate your ability to fall and stay asleep," says London.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_45-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">Sleep is also more important than you'd think for weight management and lowering heart disease risk, adds London. "Changes in your sleep patterns can also be related to hormonal shifts, so gradually increasing your activity level through a mix of strength training and cardio can help you both build lean body mass, which will help to burn more energy at rest, and contribute to improving your sleep quality," she says. That way, you can get your much-needed seven to nine hours a night.</p><h3 id=mntl-sc-block_47-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block instyle-sc-block-subheading mntl-sc-block-subheading"><span class=mntl-sc-block-subheading__text>8. Manage stress that causes stress eating and other health issues.</span></h3><p id=mntl-sc-block_48-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">It's hardly a secret that stress eating is a thing, but keeping your stress levels low is a top priority for healthy weight management. As noted previously, stress hormones like cortisol may contribute to belly fat. "When the hormone cortisol is chronically elevated, one might note sleep disturbance, weight gain, muscle weakness, brain fog, mood swings, anxiety, and fatigue," explains Dr. Akhunji.</p><p id=mntl-sc-block_50-0 class="comp mntl-sc-block mntl-sc-block-html">The good news is that all of the above can help you balance your cortisol levels and keep your thyroid hormones regular, too, says Dr. Akhunji. Eating a balanced diet, exercising and sleeping regularly, and committing to self-care practices (Meditation! Journaling! Daily walks!) are all pieces of the puzzle.</p><p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrSrbClnV6YvK57wZ6YrqypZLWmrcutn2aemam7pr%2FSaJ%2Bor12pvG64zqycZpqVobm6ecWaqw%3D%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fhow-to-lose-belly-fat.html&text=8%20Healthy%20Ways%20to%20Lose%20Belly%20Fat&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fhow-to-lose-belly-fat.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fhow-to-lose-belly-fat.html&title=8%20Healthy%20Ways%20to%20Lose%20Belly%20Fat" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fhow-to-lose-belly-fat.html&title=8%20Healthy%20Ways%20to%20Lose%20Belly%20Fat" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fhow-to-lose-belly-fat.html&title=8%20Healthy%20Ways%20to%20Lose%20Belly%20Fat" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fhow-to-lose-belly-fat.html&description=8%20Healthy%20Ways%20to%20Lose%20Belly%20Fat" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./alien-covenant-release-date-poster.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Alien: Covenant release date pushed up three months, first poster debuts">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./20th-tv-production-head-nissa-diederich-departing-1235757191.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="20th TV Production Head Nissa Diederich Departing">Next Post &rarr;</a></li></ul></div></div></div><footer><div class=container><div class=row><div class="col-lg-8 col-lg-offset-2 col-md-10 col-md-offset-1"><ul class="list-inline text-center footer-links"><li><a href title=RSS><span class="fa-stack fa-lg"><i class="fas fa-circle fa-stack-2x"></i>
