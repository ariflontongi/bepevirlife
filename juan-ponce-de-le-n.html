So, the young <strong>Juan </strong>took up the immediate opportunity to serve in the Kings army. In the military, he got to learn a lot of skills that would prove useful later in life. Also, <strong>Juan</strong> got to be squire to one Pedro Núñez de Guzmán who was one of the Kings Knights.</p><p>Moreover, he became a soldier after being a page at court for some time. As a soldier, <strong>Juan</strong> got to fight against the Moors in <strong>Granada</strong>, and they won.

So, with the blessing of the Crown, he took a party to Florida to start conquering. However, they got to meet with an overwhelming local force that saw him injured. One of the natives had wounded him during the scuffles. So, they stopped the advance and retreated to Cuba. They had underestimated the fierceness with which the local Calusa native would react.
