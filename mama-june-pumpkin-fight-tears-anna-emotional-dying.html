She was like, 'Oh, I've heard one, five and 10 years.' He looked at her and said, 'You're not going to make it 10 years. You're not going to make it five years."</p><p>"She is not living in reality at all, Mama. She does not realize she's going to die. crying I think she knows she's going to die, but," Pumpkin said before trailing off.</p><p>"She doesn't want to face it," added Mama June.</p><p><h2 class="nk-headline-heading css-1lobn43">Most read in TV</h2></p><p>Pumpkin went on to explain that Mama June tired to secure life insurance policies for Anna and her two children, Kaitlyn and Kylee.</p><p>She was unable to due to Anna not handing over the correct documentation.</p><span class=article__bc_video-caption>Honey Boo Boo slams family's graduation gift she 'can't even use' & says it 'wasn't the fancy present' she had hoped for</span><p>The pair were concerned that Anna's husband <a href=#>Eldridge Toney</a>, whom <a href=#>she married on March 4th 2023</a>, would get full custody of the kids.</p><p>"[He] isn't even the biological father of the two kids. Kylee, her dad is still in the picture, so legally he would get custody of her. But with Kaitlyn, she doesn't have a dad around or in the picture at all, so it's like, where is she going to go?" Pumpkin said.</p><p>The couple started dating in 2017, following Anna's divorce from <a href=#>Michael Cardwell</a>.</p><p><a href=#>Michael is father to Kylee</a> and Kaitlyn's dad is a man named Caleb Clark, who is no longer in her life.</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>CUSTODY BATTLE</h2><p>"She's in the reality that Eldridge, just because they're married, he's going to get the rights, but that's not the case," Mama June told the cameras.</p><p>"She says she wants Eldridge to adopt Kaitlyn, but when that time comes and Eldridge says something about it, she kind of hesitates. If you don't want Eldridge to [do it] and you want me or Pumpkin..."</p><p>It was recently announced that Mama June is set to appear in court this month against Michael for the custody of Kylee.</p><p>The U.S. Sun exclusively revealed that&nbsp;June and Michael will be in court for the first time in their nasty battle over Kaitlyn, which began just days after&nbsp;<a href=#>Anna's tragic passing in December</a>&nbsp;from&nbsp;<a href=#>adrenal cancer</a>&nbsp;at just 29 years old.&nbsp;</p><p>A recent ruling, which was addressed to June, Michael and Kaitlyn's putative father Caleb Clark, read: "The foregoing petition for adjudication as equitable caregiver having been read and considered.</p><p>"The case is hereby set for hearing on the 16th today of April 2024 at 9am."</p><p>In earlier filings, Caleb waived his rights to be involved in the proceedings over the 11-year-old.&nbsp;</p><h2 class=wp-block-heading>COURT DRAMA</h2><p>Michael currently has custody of his daughter Kylee, 8, with Anna, and has argued in court documents&nbsp;<a href=#>he is the best to care for his daughter's half sister</a>&nbsp;moving forward.</p><p>The case recently took a vicious turn, as The U.S. Sun previously reported that&nbsp;<a href=#>June made shocking allegations of abuse</a>&nbsp;against Michael in his marriage to her daughter.</p><p>"During his marriage to Anna, the plaintiff frequently physically abused Anna and the child and it would not be in the child's best interest to be in the plaintiff's care and control," June's filing stated.</p><p>In a statement to The U.S. Sun at the time, Michael's attorney said his client firmly denies the accusations.</p><h2 class=read-more-container_title data-original-text="Read More on The US Sun">Read More on The US Sun</h2><p>"Michael flatly denies any type of abuse of his children or his ex-wife or any other past girlfriend.</p><p>"We will see how June plans to prove this or any other of her supposed truths or allegations," Michael's lawyer added.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto
