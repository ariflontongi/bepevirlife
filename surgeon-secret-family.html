I put it all in a message. He responded ‘wow.’</p><p>‘In my hideous blonde wig I was like James Bond.</p><p>‘But did he forget I was a journalist?’</p><p>Benita, now in a happy relationship, told how things were ‘nagging’ at her when she got the email in May 2015 on the day after she left her job of 17-years to marry him.</p><p>‘I had these things which were nagging at me and in that moment [I got the email] I just knew,’ she says.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000673541773.jpg><p>‘But I didn't begin to understand the extent of the lies, I felt sick.

I woke up out of my love haze, I put my journalist hat back on and hired a private investigator.</p><p>‘I went full on into investigator mode as I knew he wouldn’t tell me the truth.’</p><p>She found out exactly what he’d lied about - and it was extensive.</p><p>He’d told her, as personal surgeon to the Pope, the leader of the Catholic church wanted to marry the couple.</p><p>‘He said he was having trouble finding a priest to marry us,’ she says.</p><p>‘Then he said he had ‘connections’ to the Vatican. It wasn’t surprising being a surgeon in Italy.&nbsp;</p><p>‘He [the Pope] wanted to use us as the poster couple for the catholic church to prove people who are divorced can get married in the catholic church.’</p><p>Benita admitted this concerned her, not believing his story at first. ‘But he was very clever. He said it [getting married by the Pope] would be so controversial and groundbreaking it was imperative I not&nbsp; talk to people.</p><p>‘He had people sign NDAs and said the Clintons were coming… the level he went to was insane.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000673541766.jpg><p>‘None of these people were coming. He didn’t know Pope Francis, he wasn’t his personal doctor.’</p><p>The slip from ‘Prince Charming to pathological liar’ took place over just two years.</p><p>Meeting Macchiarini , Benita wasn’t looking for love.&nbsp;</p><p>A successful TV journalist, the mum-of-one was interviewing him for a story and when they met in 2013.&nbsp;</p><p>‘I was doing a story about regenerative medicine and his name kept coming up,’ Benita, from New York, says.&nbsp;</p><p>They became friends and over time she felt herself falling for him. But her journalistic integrity meant she challenged those emotions.</p><p>‘He seemed like he was the miracle man,’ she says. ‘He was a top doctor, he spoke six or seven languages.&nbsp;</p><p>‘He was a good listener and gave me sage and solid advice.’</p><p>In mid 2013 they became a couple and in December that year they became ‘pre-engaged’ as Macchiarini, who lived in Barcelona, Spain, said he was still legally married with two children but had been separated for a long time and filing for divorced.&nbsp;</p><p>It was eight months in July 2014 afterwards they became properly engaged after Macchiarini presented her with a $100k ring with the wedding planned for July 2015.&nbsp;</p><p>‘The headline is that it started out as a beautiful love story and it ended up as a total nightmare,’ says Benita.</p><p>‘I to this day have no idea why he lied about our entire relationship.&nbsp;</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/www.thesun.co.uk/wp-content/uploads/2021/08/NINTCHDBPICT000673541770.jpg><p>‘He said he was going to pay for most of the wedding.&nbsp;</p><p>‘He wanted me to do nothing but find my dress but show up and look beautiful.
