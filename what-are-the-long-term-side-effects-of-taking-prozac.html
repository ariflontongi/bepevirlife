It is a safe and effective medication when used as directed.</span></span><h2>Can Prozac damage your brain?</h2>This is the dread side effect in psychiatry, and it can indicate brain damage. Such reactions are not rare. Neurologic agitation is estimated to occur in 10 to 25 percent of patients, and muscle spasms in 10 percent."<h2>Can you stay on Prozac for life?</h2>Sharing the Research: When patients ask about the long-term use of antidepressant medication, the truth is there really isn't any. Prozac has been around since the 1980s but published long-term studies of antidepressant medications range from 3 to 15 years.<h2>Why you should not take Prozac?</h2>The FDA requires Prozac to come with a black box warning stating that antidepressants may increase the risk of suicide in people younger than 25 years. It can lead to suicidal thoughts, or a worsening of these, in children and young adults. Other possible side effects include: decreased libido and sexual dysfunction.<h2>Does Prozac change your personality?</h2>Medication can definitely change people's personalities, and change them quite substantially. Paxil is rarely prescribed now, because of concerns about side effects and withdrawal, says Tang, but other SSRIs (such as Prozac and Zoloft) are likely to have the same effect on personality.<h2>The 'extreme' side-effects of antidepressants - BBC News</h2><p></p><h2>What can you take instead of Prozac?</h2>Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs).<p>SSRIs include fluoxetine (Prozac), paroxetine (Paxil, Pexeva), sertraline (Zoloft), citalopram (Celexa) and escitalopram (Lexapro).</p><h2>What happens if you take antidepressants for years?</h2>Those who had used antidepressants for >3 years reported more severe side effects, including “weight gain”, “addiction”, “feeling not like myself ”, “withdrawal symptoms”, and “suicidality”, than those who had been on antidepressants for ≤2 years.<h2>When should I stop taking Prozac?</h2>You may be tempted to stop taking antidepressants as soon as your symptoms ease, but depression can return if you quit too soon. Clinicians generally recommend staying on the medication for six to nine months before considering going off antidepressants.<h2>Can you stop Prozac cold turkey?</h2>The best way to stop taking your medication is not by abruptly stopping, it's by slowly tapering the medication while under a doctor's supervision. No two people will respond to tapering off SSRIs the same way. Talk with your doctor to come up with a plan that works best for you and your treatment goals.<h2>Does Prozac cause dementia?</h2>According to the study, popular Prozac-like pills known as SSRIs — selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors — and other antidepressants are associated with a twofold increase in the odds of developing some form of dementia, including Alzheimer's.<h2>Does Prozac affect memory?</h2>Finding of the study supports the concept that long-term use of fluoxetine does not impair memory and psychomotor function but improves it significantly. It may be preferred in patients who operate machinery, drive vehicle, or require alertness for the work.<h2>Can you be on antidepressants for life?</h2>MYTH: Once on antidepressants, I'll be on them for life. FACT: Not true. A general rule clinicians often use is that a person should be treated with antidepressants at least one-and-a-half times as long as the duration of the depressive episode before they can begin to be weaned off.<h2>What does Prozac withdrawal feel like?</h2>You may have flu-like symptoms including headache, muscle pain, weakness, and tiredness. Mood. You may have extreme anxiety, agitation, panic, suicidal ideation, depression, irritability, anger, mania, or mood swings. Bizarre sensations.<h2>How long can you take Prozac?</h2>Most people take fluoxetine for at least six to 12 months after they start to feel better. If you have suffered from depression in the past, you should keep taking this medication for at least two years after you start to feel better.<h2>Is it okay to miss a day of Prozac?</h2>If you miss a dose of the antidepressant Prozac (fluoxetine), you should take it as soon as you realize you've forgotten it. If it's almost time to take your next pill, however, skip the missed dose and take the next one as scheduled. Don't take more than one dose at a time.<h2>How do I wean off Prozac 10 mg?</h2>Prozac Tapering Guidelines Include:<p>You can cut the 10 mg pills in half for smaller dosing. You can even try to cut them smaller. Prozac is rather forgiving if the cuts are not exact. Dosage cuts have to be adjusted for personal tolerance and sensitivity, but a good range would be in the 10-25% range.</p><h2>Should I take Prozac in the morning or at night?</h2>For some conditions Prozac is used to treat, it's recommended to take the drug in the morning. But if taking Prozac makes you tired, it may be best to take your dose at bedtime. Your medical professional can recommend when it's best for you to take Prozac.<h2>Does Prozac cause weight gain?</h2>Experts say that for up to 25% of people, most antidepressant medications -- including the popular SSRI (selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor) drugs like Lexapro, Paxil, Prozac, and Zoloft -- can cause a weight gain of 10 pounds or more.<h2>Can antidepressants permanently damage your brain?</h2>We know that antipsychotics shrink the brain in a dose-dependent manner (4) and benzodiazepines, antidepressants and ADHD drugs also seem to cause permanent brain damage (5).<h2>Do antidepressants cause dementia?</h2>Certain antidepressants and bladder medications are linked to increased risk of dementia, according to new University of East Anglia research funded by Alzheimer's Society and published today in the British Medical Journal.<h2>Do SSRIs permanently change your brain?</h2>Some research has suggested this type of drug aids in neuroplasticity. In other words, these drugs can affect how our minds organize and form synaptic connections. Other researchers believe this type of medication has no long-term effects on our brains once the individual stops using the drug.<h2>What is a natural substitute for Prozac?</h2>Other popular and potentially effective Prozac alternative medicines include anxiety or depression relieving supplements and vitamins such as valerian and St. John's Wort 7, and serotonin-producing amino acids such as L-tryptophan.<h2>What vitamin is a natural antidepressant?</h2>B vitamins, such as folate and vitamins B6 and B12, may help treat depression.<h2>What is the #1 antidepressant?</h2>Zoloft is the most commonly prescribed antidepressant; nearly 17% of those surveyed in the 2017 antidepressant use study reported that they had taken this medication.<h2>Can coming off Prozac make you tired?</h2>Fatigue – feeling extremely tired or lethargic. Anxiety – anxiety, and nervousness are the two most common withdrawal symptoms.
