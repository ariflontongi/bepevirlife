Unfortunately, <b>Ygraine was infertile, thus incapable of giving birth</b>, but Uther, who was desperate for an heir, went to Nimueh and persuaded her to use her magic to help Ygraine.</span></span><h2>What was strange about King Arthur's birth?</h2>According to legend, Arthur's conception takes place when Uther seduces Igraine. Uther was made, by Merlin's sorcery, to resemble Igraine's husband, Gorlois. After Arthur was born, he was given to Ector to be raised in secret.<h2>What happened to Arthur's mother in Merlin?</h2>Queen Ygraine Pendragon (née de Bois) was Queen of Camelot through her marriage to King Uther Pendragon, but died giving birth to their son, Arthur Pendragon.<h2>Is Merlin Arthur's son?</h2>In the second, Merlin's magic enables the new British king Uther Pendragon to enter into Tintagel Castle in disguise and to father his son Arthur with his enemy's wife, Igerna (Igraine).<h2>Who used magic to bring about Arthur's birth?</h2>Merlin became the ally of Uther (pronounced OO-ther) and used his magic to enable Uther to spend a night with another king's wife. The child born of that union was Arthur. Merlin predicted that he would be a great king who would one day unite all of Britain.<h2>Arthur Sees his Mother "You were born of magic..."</h2><p></p><h2>Did Merlin the magician have a child?</h2>When Nimue and Merlin meet in the fifth episode, she asks the wizard why her mother instructed her to bring him the sword. By the end, viewers learn that not only did he and her mother have a relationship, but Nimue is actually Merlin's daughter.<h2>Why is Merlin so powerful?</h2>So wich is stronger? Merlin had magic since he was born, and had used/practiced it since he was a child. HIs mother realized that he needed a mentor, since she didn't have magic. So, Merlin comes to Camelot and benefits from Giaus' wisdom and past history of practicing magic.<h2>How did Merlin become immortal?</h2>Merlin's magic was so powerful he was able to achieve immortality as shown in The Diamond of the Day as he was capable of living forever as he was still alive even in modern times. His immortality may be because of his powerful magic or his destiny that ties him with the return of Arthur.<h2>Do Gwen and Arthur have a baby Merlin?</h2>But Gwen is pregnant, and gives birth to a son she names after his father. And it turns out that this is in fact the Arthur whom the dragon was referring to when he told Merlin that he and the king were two halves of a whole, and that they would unite Albion together.<h2>What's with the cat on Arthur's head?</h2>After Arthur and Gowther have completed their training and return to the group, Cath is on top of Arthur's head. Merlin asks Arthur what the strange object on top of his head is, and Arthur and Gowther merely reply that it is a mystery.<h2>Does Arthur ever find out the truth of his birth?</h2>Arthur also had an older half-sister named Morgana, who was born from an affair Uther had with her mother Vivienne some time before Ygraine's death and probably before their marriage. Arthur grew up with Morgana after Gorlois died, but remained unaware of her true paternity.<h2>Does Arthur learn the truth about his mother?</h2>In S2:EP8, Arthur finds out through Morgause that he was born of magic and how Uther more or less sacrificed Ygraine for an heir, which drives Arthur to confront Uther with a sword in his hand.<h2>Who is Lady Merlin?</h2>Bio. Merlin is the Boar's Sin of Gluttony and the mentor of Arthur Pendragon. Originally appearing as a cloaked person assisting Arthur, she finally reveals herself while fighting her apprentice Vivian. She is the greatest magician in all of Britannia.<h2>Does Arthur know Morgana is his sister?</h2>To make this point stronger, Arthur never calls Morgana his sister, since he knows under what conditions he was conceived. However, it is uknown if Morgana knows the truth about Arthur's birth, thus calling him "brother".<h2>Did King Arthur have a child with his sister?</h2>In its most famous version, the whole legend begins with King Arthur sleeping with his half-sister and conceiving a son, Mordred, and it all comes crashing down when Mordred and Arthur deal each other mortal wounds.<h2>What was the age difference between King Arthur and Guinevere?</h2>Hollywood making King Arthur and Guinevere into some sort of May-December romance is nothing new — most notable in the 1953 epic Sword of Lancelot — but Sean Connery and Julia Ormond not only had to deal with a 35-year age gap, but also the fact that they have zero chemistry on screen, and all of their scenes together ...<h2>Does Uther know Morgana is his daughter?</h2>Unfortunately, Uther's grief makes him confess to Gaius that Morgana is his daughter, which she remembers after Merlin's heals her.<h2>Who does Morgana marry in Merlin?</h2>Morgan unhappily marries Urien, with whom she has a son, Yvain. She becomes an apprentice of Merlin, and a capricious and vindictive adversary of some knights of the Round Table, all the while harbouring a special hatred for Arthur's wife Guinevere.<h2>Is Gwen enchanted by Morgana?</h2>Only a handful of episodes remain and we've got Morgana still playing a part, an enchanted Gwen, a suspicious Merlin, Mordred close to the King, and a King who is in for the ultimate betrayal.<h2>What did Merlin do with the dragon egg?</h2>Merlin takes the egg to Kilgharrah who tells him that a Dragons egg can only be opened by the Dragonlords if they give the Dragon a name. As Merlin is the last Dragonlord, he opens the egg by naming the new Dragon Aithusa.<h2>Does Arthur know Merlin has magic?</h2>Arthur was unaware of Merlin's powers until the very last episode of season 5 ("The Diamond of the Day: Part 2). In one of Merlin and Arthur's best moments, both men share a beautiful but bittersweet conversation as Arthur's discovered everything Merlin had done and sacrificed for him.<h2>Is Merlin a true story?</h2>Merlin was indeed an historical figure, living in what are now the lowlands of Scotland at the end of the sixth century A.D...an authentic prophet, most likely a druid surviving in a pagan enclave of the north."<h2>Who is the most powerful in Merlin?</h2><p>Merlin: The Main Characters, Ranked By Power</p><li>1 Merlin. From the very beginning, Merlin establishes himself as the show's most powerful character.</li><li>2 Kilgharrah. After the Great Purge, The Great Dragon got imprisoned by Uther in a cave under Camelot. ...</li><li>3 Morgana. ...</li><li>4 Mordred. ...</li><li>5 Morgause. ...</li><li>6 Gaius. ...</li><li>7 Arthur. ...</li><li>8 Guinevere. ...</li><h2>Who is Merlin's greatest enemy?</h2>Lord Lot: Father of Gawain.
