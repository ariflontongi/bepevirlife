Speaking about growing up in the capital, Keeley told <strong><a class=hm-link href=# rel=nofollow>The Guardian</a></strong>: "Just the idea of your children going out and playing out and coming in when it's dark, that just doesn't happen. The idea of doing it in central London seems even more heightened and scary. But no, it was fantastic. <strong>It makes you quite bold, growing up. </strong>It makes you not afraid of anything.

There wasn't anyone there who had become terribly successful. <strong>We were just a bunch of kids having the best time, and doing this thing that we really enjoyed. </strong>It wasn't a sort of burning ambition to be on TV. I just liked acting. And it's a really healthy thing. You're singing away and doing things that give you confidence."</p><h2>Keeley Hawes's husband Matthew Macfadyen and children</h2><p id=ec9KZoD-f3Wb data-wc=65>Keeley has three children of her own – a son Myles, 22, with her first husband, DJ and cartoonist Spencer McCallum, and a son Ralph, 16, and a daughter Maggie, 17, with her current husband Matthew Macfadyen. The couple met after starring on together and went on to tie&nbsp;the knot in November 2004, one month before Keeley gave birth to their first child.</p><img style=margin:auto;display:block;text-align:center;max-width:100%;height:auto src=https://cdn.statically.io/img/images.hellomagazine.com/horizon/original_aspect_ratio/336aff75f2b2-keeley-hawes-and-matthew-macfadyen-z.jpg><p style=text-align:center id=e_aweZ6Twt5T data-wc=10><strong>The actress has been married to Matthew Macfadyen since 2004</strong></p><p id=eS3z1gWy9OWC data-wc=109>Her relationship with Matthew proved controversial at first, given her marriage to first husband Spencer. Keeley recalled to the : "<strong>Matthew just came straight out with it and said, 'I love you' in the rain one day. </strong>I thought, oh dear, here we go." The pair married in front of just two witnesses, their friends, at a local registry. Keeley has since told : "I love being married to Matthew. And I know Matthew loves being married, too. It ties everything up and it's a statement to each other and to the world.

Keeley revealed that Spencer and his girlfriend even babysit for her. "<strong>They are just really wonderful, generous human beings who, ultimately, have always put my son and my other children first.</strong> And I can't thank them enough, really," she told magazine, adding: "Divorce doesn't have to be messy. I think as long as people concentrate on the children above themselves – which is difficult, I know – maybe that's the way to make it work."</p><h2>Keeley Hawes's role in The Durrells</h2><p id=eiIEiBk8agdj data-wc=32>In comedy-drama , Keeley played&nbsp;Louisa Durrell, mother to Gerry, Leslie, Margo and Larry.
