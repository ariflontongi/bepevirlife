The Doctor and River escape to the top of the pyramid followed by Amy and Rory. <b>The Doctor</b> marries River on the spot and whispers to her to look into his eye.</span></span><h2>Which Dr Who Did River Song Marry?</h2>However, in their efforts to brainwash River into killing the Doctor, she actually fell in love with the man instead. This led to the Eleventh Doctor marring River Song in the “Wedding of River Song.” Or so we thought.<h2>Why does the Doctor marry river?</h2>But rather than let that happen—she went to school to learn to love the guy, come on! —she decides that she'd rather destroy the universe than fulfill that function. But the universe has to be righted, so to appease her, the Doctor agrees to marry her.<h2>Is River the Doctor's wife?</h2>Kingston plays her in 15 episodes, as River becomes a companion, romantic interest and eventual wife of the Doctor in his eleventh incarnation portrayed by Matt Smith.<h2>Is the Doctor in love with River Song?</h2>River makes a point of it that she knows the Doctor doesn't love her, but the Doctor never confirms that. It also seems that anytime River claims the Doctor doesn't love her, the Doctor looks rather uncomfortable (or at least 12 did).<h2>The Doctor and River Song Get Married | The Wedding of River Song | Doctor Who</h2><p></p><h2>Did the Doctor and River have a child?</h2>Clara is the future child of the Doctor and River who's had her memory erased. The two Time Lords must be up to something on their nights away from River's prison cell.<h2>Did the Doctor married River Song?</h2>Seeing that there is only one way to pacify River, the Doctor tells Amy to uncuff him. He uses his bow tie to marry River in a rushed ceremony.<h2>Is River Amy and Rory's daughter?</h2>River Song is Amy and Rory's daughter, also known as Melody. Also known as Mels. It's complicated. River was born with the power to regenerate but used up all her remaining regenerations when she saved the Doctor after she poisoned him because she was programmed to kill him...<h2>How many regenerations does River Song have?</h2>Assuming they did not, it would appear that Melody Pond/River Song gave up TEN incarnations (9 regenerations) to save The Doctor. First Regeneration - while homeless, young Melody Pond apparently succumbed to hunger & illness, undergoing her first regeneration in the episode "Day of the Moon".<h2>What did the Doctor whisper to River?</h2>On The Wedding of River Song he whispers, "Look into my eye." and then lies and says that he just told her his name. That's when River realized that what he whispered to her when they first met was his name.<h2>Is River a Time Lord?</h2>No. River Song is not a Time Lord. The title and distinction belongs solely to those beings from the world of Gallifrey who have been indoctrinated, trained and introduced to the Time Vortex via a particular set of rituals, instruction and guidance.<h2>Why did the Doctor tell river his name?</h2>Obviously this couldn't just be a coincidence of "Oh, look, there's some person with me while I'm dying, I'll tell my name to them," because River uses her knowledge to convince the Doctor that one day, he will trust her absolutely.<h2>What happens to Donna Noble?</h2>Donna becomes an asset to the Doctor on his adventures and it is she who ultimately saves the universe in the series 4 finale, although tragically at the cost of the memories of her travels with the Doctor.<h2>Does River Song know Amy is her mother?</h2>7. River reveals her parentage – A Good Man Goes to War (again) Just as she is born as "Melody Pond" (see No. 1), the older River, now a married woman, reveals who her mum and dad are: Amy and Rory.<h2>Does Amy become a Dalek?</h2>In the tunnels below the ship, Amy questions the Doctor about what will happen to her. The Doctor explains the Nanocloud will erase her memories, "replace her love with hate", and transform her into a Dalek puppet.<h2>What's the Doctor's real name?</h2>John Smith. The Doctor's most common alias (apart from the Doctor, obviously), this is his standard pseudonym on Earth.<h2>Why is River Song backwards?</h2>River Song's Timeline isn't backwards (and neither is the Doctors). Their individual timelines move forward from birth to death (in the loosest sense of the word) but as time travellers they are free to visit any time and space in any order.<h2>What happened Clara Oswald?</h2>Clara was forced to face the Raven, killed by the touch of a Quantum Shade. However, death would not be the end for the impossible girl, and using Time Lord technology, the Doctor was able to extract Clara a second before her death, between one heartbeat and the next.<h2>Why did Amy and Rory divorce?</h2>During the mission, the Doctor engineers a reconciliation between the two. The two discuss their feelings for each other. It is revealed Amy left Rory because she has been infertile since "A Good Man Goes to War", and she knew he wanted children. The Doctor subsequently embarks on sporadic journeys with the Ponds.<h2>What happens to Rose Tyler?</h2>Rose becomes trapped in the parallel universe with Jackie and the alternate universe Pete as the walls between universes seal; she is later declared dead in her own universe.<h2>Do Martha and the Doctor get together?</h2>Martha tells Owen in the Torchwood episode "Reset", that she has a boyfriend, who is revealed to be paediatric doctor Thomas Milligan in "The Sontaran Stratagem", by which time the two are engaged — indicating that Martha has gotten over her love for the Doctor.<h2>Was Rose pregnant with the Doctor baby?</h2>Two years after "Journey's End," Rose Tyler is pregnant with the Meta-Crisis Doctor's child. The Doctor now goes by Corin because Rose decided she wanted him to have a name and refused to call him "the Doctor." Corin works as a general practitioner, while Rose is working toward a diploma in Early Years care.<h2>Did Doctor Love Rose?</h2>To some, companion Rose Tyler was the greatest love of the Doctor's life. He seemed to have a closer bond with her than almost anyone he'd travelled with before, and as time went on it was increasingly clear that she was deeply in love with him.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahpmalkae%2FqrHDZqmirpWnerS7zaA%3D</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-married-river-song.html&text=Who%20married%20River%20Song%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-married-river-song.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-married-river-song.html&title=Who%20married%20River%20Song%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-married-river-song.html&title=Who%20married%20River%20Song%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-married-river-song.html&title=Who%20married%20River%20Song%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-married-river-song.html&description=Who%20married%20River%20Song%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./wimbledon-day-12-celebrity-photos.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Wimbledon Day 12: Margot Robbie, James Norton and Hugh Grant head straight to Centre Court">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./sibi-blazic.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Sibi Blai?
