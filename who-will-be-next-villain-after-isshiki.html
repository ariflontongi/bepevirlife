Realizing the threat that he posed, Jigen ordered to have him disposed of. After Isshiki's death, Daemon is free once again, and he poses a great threat to everyone in the ninja world.</span></span><h2>Who is the antagonist after Isshiki Otsutsuki?</h2>Boruto is already setting the next major villain! Things seemed to have finally settled after the fight against Isshiki Otsutsuki. This was when Kawaki woke Boruto out of his possession from Momoshiki Otsutsuki.<h2>Who will be the next Otsutsuki after Isshiki?</h2>Following the death of Isshiki Otsutsuki, as the fan community braces itself until the next time Momoshiki appears, an old secondary antagonist has taken up the centre stage of the action. Code, the Kara inner member, has turned out to be the main antagonist at the moment, along with a new character, Eida (or Ada).<h2>Who will be the next villain in Boruto?</h2>The ghost of Isshiki then appears, and entrusts Code with his evil Otsutsuki will, establishing Kara's sole survivor as Boruto's new main villain.<h2>Who is going to beat Isshiki?</h2>1 Kaguya Otsutsuki<p>At full power, Kaguya Otsutsuki is definitely great enough to fight Isshiki Otsutsuki on par and possibly even defeat him.</p><h2>Naruto After Kurama Death, Naruto Find Out Code is Stronger Than Jigen || Boruto Episode 219</h2><p></p><h2>Who defeats Jigen?</h2>However, only from when Isshiki decided to draw out his full power into Jigen's body was he able to defeat Naruto and Sasuke at all as prior, the two shinobi took Jigen to his limits, whereupon accessing full power was Jigen able to decisively defeat both of them, sealing the former while nearly killing the latter.<h2>What happens after Isshiki died?</h2>After Isshiki's death, Daemon is free once again, and he poses a great threat to everyone in the ninja world. Having fighting skills greater than Jigen means that he's far stronger than even Naruto Uzumaki despite being a kid.<h2>Will code become a new Otsutsuki?</h2>Code has a white karma seal, granted to him by Isshiki. Although his Karma is a dud, it still provides him with Isshiki's “full power” although the extent of it is currently unknown and it can still allow him to become a new Otsutsuki.<h2>Will Kawaki become villain?</h2>Kawaki will become evil in some way. The manga revealed that the Kama was created to revived.<h2>Who can beat eida?</h2>2 Daemon Is Capable Of Killing Eida<p>According to Eida, he is the only non-Otsutsuki in the world who can kill her. Additionally, just like Eida, Daemon has had his body modified using Scientific Ninja Tools, making him incredibly powerful.</p><h2>Who can defeat eida?</h2>He could have a similar secret command for Eida too.<p>Lastly, Boruto and Kawaki are the only two among the Shinobi immune to her 'love spell' due to the Karma and the Otsutsuki-fication. Neither of them would hesitate in a fight against Eida. So all that remains is to find Code and the blue-haired cyborg.</p><h2>Who is the new vessel of Isshiki?</h2>Just like Boruto Uzumaki is to Momoshiki, Jigen serves as the vessel of Isshiki Otsutsuki, who is looking for a different vessel now since Jigen is reaching his limit.<h2>Who is the main villain in jujutsu Kaisen?</h2>Mahito - Mahito, (Jujutsu Kaisen villain,) is a human-looking cursed spirit with a patchwork face and gray eyes. His primary goal is to eliminate humanity and replace it with a population of spirits.<h2>Will Boruto become evil?</h2>It seems unlikely that Boruto will turn into a villain, at least by his own accord. However, the presence of the karma seal indicates that there is a possibility that Momoshiki Otsutsuki has possessed Boruto to go on a rampage that devastates the shinobi world.<h2>What makes Kawaki evil?</h2>Theorists believed that the process changed and Isshiki's mind was placed in Kawaki's body, which was then used to carry out the alien's bidding. However, when Isshiki died and Kawaki lost his Karma mark in the manga, fans were left to come up with new theories as to why Kawaki would turn evil.<h2>Will Boruto learn sage mode?</h2>Keeping that in mind, it isn't too hard to see that Boruto can eventually learn the Sage Mode as well. He certainly does have all the prerequisites for this technique and only needs to train hard to pull it off.<h2>Can Code beat Jigen?</h2>6 Code's Strength Surpasses That Of Jigen<p>According to Amado, Code possesses strength that exceeds that of Jigen, Isshiki Otsutsuki's previous host. This makes him a monster who can take down almost anyone in combat, including the other members of Kara and even the likes of Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha.</p><h2>Is Momoshiki stronger than Isshiki?</h2>Isshiki is one of the strongest characters in the entire Narutoverse, if not the strongest. He was able to fight and defeat both Naruto Uzumaki and Sasuke Uchiha at once and he achieved it without receiving even a single scratch. Momoshiki, on the other hand, struggled in dealing with the two.<h2>Will Boruto become an Otsutsuki?</h2>As seen from his clash against Boro and, later, Code, Boruto is extremely powerful and potentially even stronger than Naruto Uzumaki, who has lost Kurama's power now. As mentioned by Momoshiki himself, Boruto is an Otsutsuki, which means that he's far above the level of regular humans.<h2>How did Kaguya betray Isshiki?</h2>The latest chapter of Boruto has given some much-needed insight into the Ōtsutsuki civil war we didn't know occurred during the Naruto series. It turns out that Kaguya betrayed Isshiki because she didn't want to be the sacrifice fed to the God Tree, just so it could bear chakra fruit for Isshiki to eat.<h2>Who killed Isshiki Otsutsuki before?</h2>2 Isshiki Otsutsuki Died After Fighting Naruto Uzumaki & Failing To Use Kawaki To Be Reborn. Isshiki Otsutsuki was finally taken down by a collective effort of Naruto, Sasuke, Kawaki, and Boruto. Naruto, using his Baryon Mode, did most of the work and reduced Isshiki's lifespan to mere minutes.<h2>What is Isshiki eye called?</h2>With the Byakugan, Isshiki gains near 360° vision and is able to see through objects without any problem whatsoever. He can also see the chakra system of people, just like every other user of this Kekkei Genkai in the Naruto world.<h2>Who is the Otsutsuki King?</h2>It's Otsutsuki Tarine no Mikoto. This means that in the Boruto story his name should be Tarine Otsutsuki. It sounds like a fitting name for the king.<h2>Is Naruto gonna beat Jigen?</h2>With Naruto using Tailed Beast Form and Sasuke using Susanoo, they fight Jigen together, a scene similar to the end of Naruto. Despite using their strongest jutsus, Naruto and Sasuke still fail to defeat Jigen.<p class=postsid style=color:rgba(255,0,0,0)>ncG1vNJzZmivp6x7qrrTnqmvoZWsrrOxwGeaqKVfm66ye9ahpmavmaG5bq7EZqWesKRiw6q4y5qgp2WRm8GmvoyiqqygmaC2</p><hr><section id=social-share><div class="list-inline footer-links"><div class=share-box aria-hidden=true><ul class=share><li><a href="//twitter.com/share?url=%2fwho-will-be-next-villain-after-isshiki.html&text=Who%20will%20be%20next%20villain%20after%20Isshiki%3f&via=username" target=_blank title="Share on Twitter"><i class="fab fa-twitter"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.facebook.com/sharer/sharer.php?u=%2fwho-will-be-next-villain-after-isshiki.html" target=_blank title="Share on Facebook"><i class="fab fa-facebook"></i></a></li><li><a href="//reddit.com/submit?url=%2fwho-will-be-next-villain-after-isshiki.html&title=Who%20will%20be%20next%20villain%20after%20Isshiki%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Reddit"><i class="fab fa-reddit"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.linkedin.com/shareArticle?url=%2fwho-will-be-next-villain-after-isshiki.html&title=Who%20will%20be%20next%20villain%20after%20Isshiki%3f" target=_blank title="Share on LinkedIn"><i class="fab fa-linkedin"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.stumbleupon.com/submit?url=%2fwho-will-be-next-villain-after-isshiki.html&title=Who%20will%20be%20next%20villain%20after%20Isshiki%3f" target=_blank title="Share on StumbleUpon"><i class="fab fa-stumbleupon"></i></a></li><li><a href="//www.pinterest.com/pin/create/button/?url=%2fwho-will-be-next-villain-after-isshiki.html&description=Who%20will%20be%20next%20villain%20after%20Isshiki%3f" target=_blank title="Share on Pinterest"><i class="fab fa-pinterest"></i></a></li></ul></div></div></section></article><ul class="pager blog-pager"><li class=previous><a href=./why-is-pink-sand-pink.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Why is pink sand pink?">&larr; Previous Post</a></li><li class=next><a href=./who-is-sharlee-jeter-dating-now-exploring-her-past-relationships-current-status-and-rumors-html.html data-toggle=tooltip data-placement=top title="Who is Sharlee Jeter Dating Now?
